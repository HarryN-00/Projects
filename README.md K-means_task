Description
This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering to categorise countries based on various economic and health indicators using the Country-data.csv dataset. By analysing features like 
GDP per capita, child mortality rate, and inflation, we categorise countries into three distinct clusters: Developed, Developing, and Undeveloped.

1.	Installation Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/HarryN-00/Kmeans_task.git
Navigate the project directory: cd Projects
Read & install all dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 
Country Data (CSV): https://1drv.ms/f/c/d2524e93f1fffa2a/EiTCPCnMuj5JuI2M_a7-IKMB25oGhOmDNzG-jbnV85soGg?e=FXjcUS 

2.	Usage
Once the project is set up, you can run the code by executing the Jupyter notebook K-means_task.ipynb.
Execute the code: Run all cells

3.	Preprocessing and Feature Selection
The first step in the analysis is to preprocess the dataset. This includes:
•	Handling missing values
•	Selecting the relevant continuous features, such as health, inflation, life expectancy and so on, which are used to categorise countries into clusters.

4.	Correlation Map
Before performing clustering, we analyse the relationships between the features. A correlation matrix is plotted to understand how different variables are related. This step is crucial for identifying which features are most influential in the clustering process.

5.	K-Means Clustering
The core of this project is the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm. Here, the following steps are taken:
•	Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). The optimal K is selected at the point where the inertia starts to level off.
•	Silhouette Score: Provides a measure of how well each data point fits into its assigned cluster, ensuring that the chosen K is the best.
After evaluating both methods, I determined that K=3 is the optimal number of clusters.

6.	Visualisations
Several visualisations are created to help interpret the clustering results:
1.	Subplots of continuous independent features against GDP per capita: These plots help in visualising the relationship between various features and GDP per capita.
2.	Subplots of continuous independent features against child mortality: These plots reveal how the features relate to child mortality.
3.	Scatterplots of Clusters:
o	Child Mortality vs. GDP per capita: This scatter plot visualises how countries with low GDP per capita tend to have higher child mortality rates, and vice versa.
o	Inflation vs. GDP per capita: The scatter plot helps demonstrate how inflation varies across different stages of economic development.

7.	Results and Conclusions
The results of the K-Means clustering and subsequent visualisations reveal significant insights about the economic and health status of countries.
1.	Child Mortality vs. GDP per capita:
o	Green Cluster (Undeveloped Countries): This cluster represents the least developed countries, as they have the highest child mortality rates and the lowest GDP per capita.
o	Blue Cluster (Developed Countries): These countries are characterised by high GDP per capita and relatively low child mortality rates, reflecting better health and living standards.
o	Red Cluster (Developing Countries): The countries in this cluster have intermediate GDP per capita and child mortality rates, indicating that they are in the process of development.
2.	Inflation vs. GDP per capita:
o	Blue Cluster (Developed Countries): These countries show high GDP per capita and moderate inflation, reflecting stable economies.
o	Green Cluster (Undeveloped Countries): Countries in this cluster have low GDP per capita but relatively high inflation, which is a common characteristic of economically struggling nations.
o	Red Cluster (Developing Countries): These countries have GDP per capita and inflation rates that fall between the blue and green clusters, indicating a transition from underdeveloped to developed status.
